# StudentSpender App

A budgeting app designed to help students who are studying abroad better manage their money by being able to distribute their costs between multiple categories such as 
accommodations, food, travel, entertainment, shopping, and etc.

## Functionalities 
The main goal of our website is to allow students to track their spending and receive a personalized budgeting plan. To achieve this users are able to create an account, log in and have their passwords encrypted. If a user forgets a password they have the option to reset it. They are able to have a budget generated using an OpenAI API based on total budgets, spending habits and duration of their time abroad. Users are also able to add expenses and provide details such as type of expenses, amount, and date. Users can then delete any expense they would like to. Based on budget and expense data users are provided with a budget progress bar displaying the percent of their budget left. Along with the budget bar and recent expenses, users can see live currency exchanges on the homepage. They can enter two currency abbreviations and the amount to be converted and the exchange is displayed. The website also allows users to edit profile data and the database gets updated. The website allows for easy navigation to various tabs using the menu bar and users can also log out of their account using the navigation bar.

## Future improvements
Given more time, we could make several improvements to the website. One enhancement would be successfully implementing the "Sign up with Google" button on the login and signup pop-up pages. Another potential improvement would be adding functionality for users to upload or edit their profile picture on the profile page. We also wanted to allow users to export their budget and expense data into a PDF or CSV format. Lastly, incorporating an advice section would be beneficial for users, providing tips on budgeting and guiding them towards smarter spending habits.
